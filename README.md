<h1>Password Generator</h1>

A random password is generated when a user uses the prompts to pick the cirtera to a password

Functions:
When a user clicks on "Generate Password" they will be propted with a series of questions.
These questions include:
  *How many characters long do they want their password (must be between 8-128 characters)
  *Do they want uppercase letters?
  *Do they want numbers?
  *Do they want special characters?
  
 If the user picks a number less than 8 or more than 128, they will be looped back to enter a correct number.
 If the user does not pick uppercase, numbers OR special characters, the user will be looped back through the prompts.
 
 When all parameters have been met, a random password that meets all the criteria that they entered will appear in the box.
